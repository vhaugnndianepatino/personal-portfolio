**Personal Portfolio Website**
==============================


Welcome to my personal portfolio! This website showcases my background, technical skills, projects, and professional experience. It is built using **React** and designed to provide potential employers, collaborators, or anyone interested in my work, a clear view of who I am and what I can do.


**Purpose**
-----------


The purpose of this portfolio is to provide a professional yet personal platform where I can display my work, skills, and achievements in a way that is easily accessible. It serves as both a **dynamic resume** and an interactive showcase of my **technical projects**, giving visitors an opportunity to get to know me better and explore my work in more detail. The website is also designed to be user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing, reflecting both my design sense and technical capabilities.


This portfolio consists of several key sections:


### **1\. Home Section**


*    A personal overview of who I am, my passion and what I aspire to be in the future. A downloadable PDF version of my professional resume, summarizing my work experience, key accomplishments, and skills.


### **2\. About Page**


*   Another overview of who I am outside school. My part time hustles and my interests.


*   A visual presentation of my personal interests.


### **3\. Education Page**


*   A detailed overview of my academic background, including degrees, schools, and relevant coursework.
   
*  This page provides a quick and comprehensive way for potential employers to review my educational background and professional preparedness.


### **4\. Portfolio Page**


*   A showcase of my technical projects, complete with descriptions, technologies used, and links to GitHub repositories or live demos.
   
*   A dedicated Certificates section to highlight relevant professional certifications, online courses, or awards.


*   A Tech Stack section presenting the programming languages, frameworks, and tools I am proficient in, with interactive icons or logos for quick visual recognition.


*   Visitors can explore the work I have done, understand my approach, view my coding style, and see the full range of skills and certifications I bring to the table.


   
### **5\. Contact Page**


*   A page allowing visitors to reach out to me via a contact form, email address, or through links to my professional social media profiles (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub).
